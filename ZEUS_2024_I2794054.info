Description:
  'The azimuthal correlation angle between the scattered lepton and leading jets in ZEUS lepton-proton 
  collisions, with beam energies of 920 GeV and 27.5 GeV. The centre-of-mass energy is 318 GeV, elasticity
  between $0.04 < y < 0.7$, and outgoing lepton energy $E_e > 10$ GeV. Jets are reconstructed in the range
  $-1.5 < |\eta| < 1.8$ using the kt algorithm. The lepton polar angle must be between $140 < \theta_e < 180$ 
  degrees.'
